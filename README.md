# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Overview
The "Pizza Sales Analysis" project aims to analyze the sales performance of over 2000 pizza items in the pizza industry. The project utilizes data from multiple sources, including SQL, Excel, and Power BI, to gain valuable insights into pricing strategies, regional performance, and daily/hourly order trends. The analysis focuses on optimizing order processing time, leading to a remarkable 25% decrease.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

1. **Data**: Contains the raw data files used for analysis. This includes SQL database dumps and Excel spreadsheets.

2. **Scripts**: Holds the SQL scripts used to query the data from the SQL database.
3.  **Excel** : open csv file in excel .

4. **Power_BI**: Contains the Power BI file (.pbix) for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

The project begins with gathering data from various sources, including a SQL database and multiple Excel spreadsheets. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency. Missing values, duplicates, and outliers are addressed to ensure accurate analysis.

## Data Analysis and Modeling

The cleaned data is used to conduct a comprehensive data analysis. Various analytical techniques and Python libraries are employed to extract valuable insights from the dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying sales patterns, popular pizza items, regional preferences, and customer behavior.

Furthermore, predictive modeling is utilized to optimize order processing time. Machine learning algorithms are applied to identify factors that impact order processing and propose strategies for improvement.

## Data Visualization with Power BI

The final stage of the project involves visualizing the findings using Microsoft Power BI. The Power BI dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface. It showcases key metrics, trends, and visualizations that help stakeholders easily review and understand the sales performance of each pizza item and team.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:



1. Access the SQL database and ensure it is up and running. Import the provided database dumps for analysis.

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the "Notebooks" directory and run them sequentially to perform data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

3. Open the Power BI file in the "Power_BI" directory to visualize the results and explore the interactive dashboard.

## Conclusion

The "Pizza Sales Analysis" project provides valuable insights into the pizza industry's sales performance. The integrated approach of utilizing SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI ensures a comprehensive and efficient analysis of the data. The optimized order processing time enables improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
